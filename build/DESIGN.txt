How the Site Gets Updated
=========================

Contributors to the www.python.org website check out a copy of the content
from subversion, make changes, **test** them locally, and check them back in.
Processes on dinsdale.python.org automatically rebuild the live site.

Upon check-in, a subversion hook (``/data/repos/www/hooks/update-web.py``) runs
that does two things:

1) Synchronizes the newer content of the repository with a local checked-out
   image on the webserver of all the content files that go into building the
   site.  This image is located under::

     /data/ftp.python.org/pub/www.python.org/

   The check-in hook also adds to the check-out image any new directories,
   by running in each an "svn update" command, and invokes the *make*
   command in each directory that has modified, added or deleted files.

2) Writes into a flag file the subversion revision number of either this
   check-in or that already in the flag file, whichever is higher.  This
   flag file is located at::

     /data/website-build/build/status/buildqueued

Action #1 is so that we can run a build operation on that check-out image that
turns the content files into static HTML that is served by Apache.  However,
in the case of closely-spaced checkins, we do not want multiple builds running
concurrently, hence action #2.  This flag file is checked by a CRON job that
runs every 5 minutes under Andrew Kuchling's account (amk)::

    umask 002 ; \
        /data/website-build/build/scripts/post-commit-svnup-binary \
        >> /data/website-build/build/status/postcommitlog.txt 2>&1

scripts/post-commit-svnup-binary is a wrapper around
scripts/post-commit-svnup.py.  If the flag is present, it runs
scripts/server-build.py, which then runs new-build/build.py as
follows::

  new-build/build.py \
    --cache=/data/tmp/pydotorg.cache \
    -v \
    -d data \
    -o out \
    -r images,styles,files,js

which means:

     Process the tree of content markup files starting a directory 'data' and
     place the result under the directory 'out'.  Provide verbose process
     messages to stdout, and cache the dependency tree within the pickle file
     'pydotorg.cache'.  Afterward, copy the resource files in the directories
     'images', 'styles', 'files' and 'js' under the output tree.


Note(s):
1) Progress messages of this overall procedure are logged in
   ``/data/website-build/build/status/postcommitlog.txt``.

2) The set of files processed is limited to:

       .ht, .h, .asc, .rst, .html, .txt, .db, .gif, .png, .jpg, .yml.

   All other file types are silently dropped from consideration.
